# Messaging-Chatroom
Messaging chatroom that will be using sockets and threading 
This project is in python3 and i used this website as a tutorial guide:
https://pythonprogramming.net/server-chatroom-sockets-tutorial-python-3/
For that reason I say thank you to the creator of the website post.
Use threading to see work at the same time with the sending and reciving messaging in the client part.
Is my first project and my first time using python so the code part is almost a copy of the tutorial, I adapt some conditions to my own understanding. In conclution, if you want more information about the theme pls check out the link of the website on top of this. 
:) See you next time.
